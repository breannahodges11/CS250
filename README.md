•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs can be done through talking to users and listening to what they want or need.  In Module 3, there was a focus group between the product owner and some SNHU Travel customers.  The product owner asked about what they would like to see and listened to their responses.  This gave the Product Owner a place to start with what the users are looking for in a product.  The Product Owner then created user stories based on what the customers said and included things they would like to see.  By doing this, the user stories help to implement what the users need out of the product.  User stories are basically a roadmap that follow what is important to the user.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The best way to approach developing a program is to first identify the project and what needs to be done.  Next, decide what you want to see out of the program, what is the desired outcome.  You then need to create a vision for the project and analyze what needs to be done to achieve the desired outcome.  There needs to be some level of planning and estimation done.  Sprint planning, release planning, and daily standups need to be done.
In the future I hope to incorporate many agile processes into my development work.  Daily standup meetings are great to find out what is going on within a project.  Sprint planning is also crucial in a project.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development you must be able to communicate effectively, understand technical tasks and be able to explain them, work independently and collaboratively, and have common goals with other team members.  There must also be a high level of performance and professionalism.  You should know how to give and receive feedback and own your work. As with any other team, you should trust other team members.
